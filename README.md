# Active Directory: Overview and Requirements


<h2>Overview</h2>
In this four-part guide, we will walk through the process of setting up a virtual environment in Azure. This includes creating a resource group, a virtual network with a subnet, and two virtual machines (VMs). One VM will run Windows Server and serve as our domain controller, while the other will run Windows 10. After setting up the domain on the Windows Server VM, we’ll join the Windows 10 VM to that domain. Once joined, the Windows 10 VM will recognize all domain user accounts. Using PowerShell, we’ll then create approximately 10,000 domain users, and you’ll be able to log into the Windows 10 VM using any of these accounts.
